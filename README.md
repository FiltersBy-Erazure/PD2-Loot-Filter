# **Season 12 Suffering Update:**

My loot filters are updated for the Season 12 Suffering ladder reset on November 28th 2025

After selecting the version of the filter from the launcher, be sure to click "Save Filter" on the right side afterwards

## Versions of the Filter

- The **Erazure - Main** version displays standard names for all high runes and super rare items
- The **Erazure - BIG GG** version shows "BIG GG" or "LIL GG" when the following items drop while your character is outside of town:
  - BIG GG
    - Sur, Ber, Jah, Cham, Zod
    - Vial of Lightsong, Lilith's Mirror
  - LIL GG
    - Demonic Cube 
    - Vex, Ohm, Lo
    - Larzuk's Puzzlebox
- The PoE version of each filter adds sound notifications from PoE to certain items

# **Loot Filter Customization and Edits**

- I recommend using either [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) for editing a customized version of the filter
  
- Because the filter uses custom symbols that require a specific encoding, we will need to follow the steps below to ensure that the file does not default to UTF-8 encoding

- Avoid using the copy to local button in the launcher as it results in encoding issues
  
## VS Code

- Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) from Visual Studio Code's website

- Open up the program after installing it

- Under File - Preferences - Settings - Search for "Encoding"

- De-select **Auto Guess Encoding**

- Set **Western (Windows 1252)** as the default character set encoding
      
- Under File - Preferences - Extensions - Search for "TommyC90"

- Install the Diablo 2 Loot Filter Hints Extension

- This adds helpful color coding to the syntax of .filter files
